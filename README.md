# Heroku-Scheduled-Python-App

This is a sample python app for Heroku that executes using cronjob ( schuedling ) without using any external resources required like using weblink.

I am using an addon named `Heroku Scheduler` (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/scheduler)

Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) installed.

## Steps:

- [ ] Modify the file `code.py` according to your need.
- [ ] Create a virtual environment for your app. `py -m venv venv-name-here`.
- [ ] Activate that virtual environment.
- [ ] Install all required libraries for your python app in that environment.
- [ ] Run the script `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Commit and push the code.
- [ ] Star this repo if that helped you ðŸ˜Š.

## Installation:
